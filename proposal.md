## Behavioral Responses to Wildfire in Flammulated Owls

Bird species show certain behavioral responses to large-scale landscape changes. Flammulated Owls, migratory insectivorous raptors, may be an exception to this pattern, however. Following Colorado's Hayman Fire, which burned 138,000 acres in 2002, few individuals migrated out of the burn scar. Instead, the original occupants returned year after year to breed, while few new breeders were documented in the area. From this observation, we infer that Flammulated Owls do not significantly adapt their behavior in response to large-scale disturbances, but rather maintain consistent behaviors that sustain populations as long as disturbances occur at natural frequencies and severities. In the case of the Hayman Fire, it is possible that, whereas a more responsive species would have relocated to higher quality habitat, Flammulated Owls continued breeding in the same site.

This project will examine whether Flammulated Owls changed one important breeding behavior in response to the Hayman Fire: the frequency of prey deliveries to nests. After high intensity wildfires, many species change the frequency of prey deliveries to their young based on changes in prey quality and abundance. To assess this, I will use data recorded by field crews between 2004 and 2019 in the Hayman Fire Study Area (HFSA) and a nearby unburned control site, Missouri Gulch Study Area (MGSA). This data is made available to me thanks to Dr. Brian Linkhart, the PI of a 40-year Flammulated Owl demographic study. It is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, which will be provided in the project repository as a CSV file.

The main questions I will attempt to answer in this project are:
1. Where are Flammulated Owl nests in relation to severity of burn in HFSA?
2. How do prey delivery rates change throughout the night?
3. How do prey delivery rates in HFSA compare to rates in MGSA?
