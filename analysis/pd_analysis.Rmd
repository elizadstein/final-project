##Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



##Load data

```{r}

pdOriginal <- read.csv("~/final-project/data/pd_main.csv")

#correct class for two time intervals
as.integer(pdOriginal$'166', pdOriginal$'211')

#rename the first column, which imported with a special character
names(pdOriginal)[1] <- "nest"
```



##Tidy data

First, get each time interval into its own row by gathering the data.
```{r}

pdGathered <- pdOriginal %>%
  gather(
    t0:t526, key = "time_interval",
    value = num_pd,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )

```

Select observations for males only:
```{r}

pdMales <- pdGathered %>%
  filter(
    sex == "M"
  )

```

Only want observations from Hayman (nest starts with "C") and Missouri (nest starts with "B"). 

First, separate "study_site" from "nest," removing the territory ID and the original column. Then, filter for only Hayman ("C") and Missouri ("B")
```{r}

pdHayMissou <- pdMales %>%
  separate(col = nest, into = c("study_site", NA), sep = 1, remove = TRUE) %>%
  filter(study_site == "B" | study_site == "C")

```


```{r}


  

```
