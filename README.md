# Nest Provisioning in a Fire Disturbed Landscape

This repository contains the R code and original data for compiling an analysis for my final project in BIOL-4800 Reproducible Research in R.

The project is made possible by Dr. Brian Linkhart's 40-year study of Flammulated Owls in Colorado's Manitou Experimental Forest, where I had the opportunity to aid in data collection from 2017 to 2020. Prey Delivery data remains unpublished.
